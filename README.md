🛡️ NEER – Dual Safety Ecosystem
Women Safety Band & Child Safety Locket (MVP)


📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW

NEER – Dual Safety Ecosystem is an IoT-inspired real-time safety system designed to address two critical safety needs:

Women Safety during emergencies

Child Safety through continuous monitoring

The system functions as a dual wearable ecosystem, consisting of a Women Safety Smart Band and a Child Safety Smart Locket, both connected to a Firebase-backed web dashboard for real-time location tracking and emergency event logging.



🔴 PROBLEM STATEMENT

In emergency situations:

Panic limits the ability to use mobile phones

Time-critical decisions are required

Continuous safety monitoring is often unavailable

Women need a panic-friendly emergency trigger, while parents need a reliable child monitoring system.



💡 PROPOSED SOLUTION

NEER offers a dual-mode safety approach:

A one-click SOS trigger for women to instantly log emergency location data

A real-time child location monitoring system for parents

All safety data is logged instantly to the cloud, ensuring fast response and reliable access.
